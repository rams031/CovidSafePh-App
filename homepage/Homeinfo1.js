                    COVID-19 is known to target a personâ€™s respiratory system. Infected patients may exhibit symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, and in some cases, muscle pain and sore throat. Some patients may also be asymptomatic.  
                    On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic due to the exponential increase of the number of cases in more than 100 countries.
                    On March 16, 2020. President Rodrigo Roa Duterte placed the entire Philippines under a State of Calamity amid the threats posed by COVID-19.
